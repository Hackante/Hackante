### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Hackante. I mostly develop Discord bots ~~altough I often don't finish them~~. And I am currently working in a small team at this organisation: [wwosimulation](https://github.com/wwosimulation). Currently I try to switch my projects from JavaScript to TypeScript. 

You can contact me at any time via Discord: @Hackante#1482.
